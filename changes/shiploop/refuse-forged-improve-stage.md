bump: patch

A saved run whose Improve child sits at a stage that never starts one (anything other than a planning stage or the final carry-forward), or whose Improve result belongs to such a step, is now refused on load with a message naming that stage. `workspace return` relies on this check instead of its own active-child guard.
