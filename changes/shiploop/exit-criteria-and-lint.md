Each step's exit criteria now carry their confirmation. Step-plan duties write every completion criterion as `<condition>. Confirm by: <command, observation, or inspection>; pass when <expected result>`. This includes whether inspection is sufficient, and an explicit `unconfirmable here` marker instead of dropping the criterion.

The implement duty and chain worker packets loop until each criterion is confirmed. They never download a tool to confirm a criterion. They stop BLOCKED only for a criterion that is proven unachievable, and FAILED after 3 genuine attempts. Workers write an `exit-criteria.json` receipt, verify checks each item, and a retried step carries its prior attempts and their rejection reasons.

New script-owned lint, set by the `lint: fix|report|off` run option (`--lint` on `init` and `workspace start`, `lint-mode --set` mid-run; new runs default to `fix`). It runs on entry to static-checks and verify. The model receives each linter's exact command and complete output, an applied auto-fix diff, per-file coverage and install recommendations. Deletion-type and unsafe fixes, version-manager shims, repo-local binaries and linters that execute repo code are never applied or run. Lint output is supporting output, never exit-criteria evidence.
