Every packet now carries a script-rendered status block: where the run is (phase, work item and stage group), what was just accepted, what comes next, the item's plan sentence and the completed items. The host shows it unchanged instead of writing its own progress summary. Each saved transition also writes `status.md` in the run directory, and the new `shiploop status` verb prints the block. On Claude Code, the optional `scripts/shiploop-status-hook` PostToolUse hook shows the block to you directly from ShipLoop's own output; see `references/status-display.md` for the settings snippet.
