bump: minor

Plan Dispatcher leaves the `backchain` plugin and ships as its own `plan-dispatcher` plugin; `backchain:plan-dispatcher` no longer exists, so install `plan-dispatcher` instead. Backchain's source now lives in Skill Craft, and `./install.sh --skill backchain` installs it from a Skill Craft checkout. The card now says that the harness, schema, fixtures and samples it mentions live in the separate Backchain development checkout and are not shipped with the skill.
