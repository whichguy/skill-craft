"""The repository's ShipLoop knowledge home, kept and committed at the end of planning.

Owner decision 2026-09-26: planning produces a spec and environment knowledge that
outlive the run.  The model writes them under ``docs/shiploop/`` during planning;
at four closes ShipLoop checks the expected files (prepare, test-spec, release-plan,
release-verify), screens them for credentials,
refuses a living spec that drops an earlier requirement ID, and commits exactly
``docs/shiploop/`` and the repository index ``SHIPLOOP.md`` with its own message.
A later run starts from these files.

    docs/shiploop/README.md          index: what each file answers, the feature list
    docs/shiploop/spec.md            living product spec; stable requirement IDs, a Retired section
    docs/shiploop/environment.md     targets, aliases, working commands, platform facts
    docs/shiploop/test-strategy.md   harnesses, suites, commands, the ID convention
    docs/shiploop/features/<slug>/   this run: spec.md (delta), plan.md, test-spec.md,
                                     system-tests.md, release-plan.md, outcome.md
