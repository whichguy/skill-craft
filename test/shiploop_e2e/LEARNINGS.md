## Run 1 — 2026-09-26 — battleship, Grok grok-4.7 medium, ShipLoop 0.31.0 build

- Outcome: stopped by the 150-turn cap after 2,327 s; Grok reported $10.88. ShipLoop was at
  W1 `regression` (revision 26), 16 stages accepted, 17 still ahead. The product existed only in
  ShipLoop's external worktree; `work/` stayed empty, so every product check failed.
- Product: 12/12 `node --test` pass and all harness checks pass when run against the worktree;
  playable page; correct 400/404 handling. One real defect: `lib/game.js:66` memoizes the first
  response per cell, so re-firing a cell after the game ended returns `gameOver: false`,
  contradicting ShipLoop's own requirement R-8. No planned case covered repeat-after-game-over;
  HTTP tests never assert hit/sunk/gameOver:true through the API.
- Time: preparation ~21 min (spec 7, test-strategy 6), the whole work item ~14 min.
- Turns: 223 tool calls; ~60% overhead (run records 22%, CLI 18%, skill reads 9%, other 9%),
  ~40% product edits and test runs. Improve children at spec, test-strategy, plan, step-plan and
  test-spec took ~39% of calls and produced three small doc edits (b041544, eb8c529, 4c36017).
- Context: one conversation grew from 33 K to 331 K tokens per model call (32.7 M cached tokens);
  cost grows roughly with turns squared.
- Truncation: Grok caps tool output at ~20 KB. Seven preparation packets (23–36 KB) and
  Improve's 48 KB SKILL.md were cut off; the model recovered by reading Grok's terminal logs.
- Orchestrator: fixed 34-stage graph plus 8 unconditional Improve children (≥50 callbacks for one
  item); Improve requires exactly two reviews; not-applicable stages are model-justified one turn
  each; return to the source happens only at release; Plan Dispatcher not exercised (inline, 1 item).
- Keepalive: reading a saved packet in an unrelated Claude session bound that session to the run
  and blocked its stop (observe binds on any SHIPLOOP-RUN marker in tool output).
- Harness lessons: grade run state wherever ShipLoop puts it; `node --test` passed with zero tests
  until the check required a passing test; Grok logs tool output as a byte array plus
  `output_for_prompt` (measure the latter).
